Spring XD - Project Carlos Cleanser Module
============================================

The project includes sample unit and integration tests, including the ability to test the module in an embedded single node container. 

## Requirements

In order to install the module and run it in your Spring XD installation, you will need to have installed:

* Spring XD version 1.1.x ([Instructions](http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/current/reference/html/#getting-started))

## Building with Maven

	$ mvn clean package

The project's [pom][] declares `spring-xd-module-parent` as its parent. This adds the dependencies needed to compile and test the module and also configures the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin][] to package the module as an uber-jar, packaging any dependencies that are not already provided by the Spring XD container.


## Using the Cleanser Module

The uber-jar will be in `[project build dir]/module-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`. To install and register the module to your Spring XD distribution, use the `module upload` Spring XD shell command. Start Spring XD and the shell:

	$ module upload --file path-to/cleanser-module-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --name taxiCleanser --type processor


Now create and deploy a stream:

	xd:>stream create --name taxiStuff --definition "reactor-ip | taxiCleanser | log" --deploy

Post some data:

	$ cat readable_sample.csv | nc localhost 3000


You should see the stream output in the Spring XD log:
